# Recipe generator api

Recipes rarely are impossible to make without some ingredients. That is the premise here. 

To do this the API works with matching ingredients to components of meals, and then components of meals to meals. 

For example, if I have steak and chips but no asparagus, I could instead use other greens. Currently, the json *"database"* manually updated but I want to improve this in the future by allowing posts to update it and build an automatic way of getting this information (perhaps with ML-prod2vec).

Any ideas please shout.

The future use case for this is to align with my trello board and Alexa skill so I can get suggestions immediately without looking in the fridge and thinking.
